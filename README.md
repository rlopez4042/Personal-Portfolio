# PersonalPortfolio

This project is a personal portfolio website I can use to display my other projects. It will be built using React. My intention is to create a site that is Responsive, Dynamic, and Intuitive to navigate. It be built with a Mobile First design, and will utilize dynamic transitions as the user scrolls through the site, helping it come to life.
